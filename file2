GIT_EDITOR is the editor Git will launch when the user needs to edit some text (a commit message, for example). If unset, EDITOR will be used.

Repository Locations
Git uses several environment variables to determine how it interfaces with the current repository.

GIT_DIR is the location of the .git folder. If this isn’t specified, Git walks up the directory tree until it gets to ~ or /, looking for a .git directory at every step.

GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES controls the behavior of searching for a .git directory. If you access directories that are slow to load (such as those on a tape drive, or across a slow network connection), you may want to have Git stop trying earlier than it might otherwise, especially if Git is invoked when building your shell prompt.

GIT_WORK_TREE is the location of the root of the working directory for a non-bare repository. If not specified, the parent directory of $GIT_DIR is used.

GIT_INDEX_FILE is the path to the index file (non-bare repositories only).

GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY can be used to specify the location of the directory that usually resides at .git/objects.

GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES is a colon-separated list (formatted like /dir/one:/dir/two:…) which tells Git where to check for objects if they aren’t in GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY. If you happen to have a lot of projects with large files that have the exact same contents, this can be used to avoid storing too many copies of them.
